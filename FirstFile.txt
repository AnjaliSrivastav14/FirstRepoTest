Git commands
This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"
git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"
Change the user name and e-mail address to your own. You will probably also want to use this when registering to GitHub later on.
Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.

git init : to initilize the repo
git add fileName: to add a file to staging area
git commit -m commitMessage : to commit all the file from staging area to repo

git fetch vs git pull:
-->git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo
